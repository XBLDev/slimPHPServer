# slimPHPServer
Sample code and experiments of building LAMP server with slim php framework, expected to be testing on Amazon Ubuntu server in the future

Comment 28/09/2017:

First commit, following code on: https://github.com/slimphp/Tutorial-First-Application/tree/master/src, and 
tutorial on: https://www.slimframework.com/docs/tutorial/first-app.html

The original code seems to use Phinx instead of mysql, so had to setup DB, tables in phpMyAdmin, and made a new user
as well since the default root user uses no password, which is really dangerous.

This framework should work well with Amazon Ubuntu server based on what i've read so far, and is LAMP stack, so 
maybe I'll use this to setup a server in the future.
